        <p>Aristia, 3 years old. He is a reincarnation from another world (Japan). The studio room before reincarnation was too small, and when I was reincarnated, I couldn't help but ask God for the best storage in the world. And that wish was granted. Reincarnated as a poor peasant, Aristia is blessed with a kind family and friends, and gradually develops a talent for magic. It seems that the Marquis has taken notice of Aristia......</p>

        <h3 id="b1">第一章  <br>(I can't fit my luggage in the small room.)</h3>
        <p>I'm Miku Matsui, 18 years old. Heavenly loneliness. My father died before I can remember, and I don't even remember his face. My mother, who raised me by myself, died of illness the other day. That's why I gave up on going to university and got a job after graduating from high school. It was my mother's wish to go on to higher education, but I wanted to make it easier for her as soon as possible, so I changed my course without permission, which was unexpectedly useful. I rented a studio apartment that was close to my workplace and had the lowest rent. Fortunately, my mother had saved enough money to go to college. If you work hard, you will manage to eat. Nevertheless...... Narrow. He looks at the stacked cardboard boxes and sighs heavily. I barely put a bed and a desk, but the rest of the floor was box, box, box...... A pile of boxes. Is it the Leaning Tower of Pisa? There are a number of cardboard towers that lean like that. What's wrong with this? Failed. Since it was my first time renting a room, I was only thinking about the rent. There is only a small closet here, and there is no storage. The movers' brothers, who managed to pile up the boxes in Mr./Ms. room, looked sorry. Sigh...... Do you have no choice but to declutter? I thought I had gotten rid of it quite a bit...... I couldn't throw away the things that reminded me of my life with my mother. Can't help it. If you work for two or three years, you'll be able to save a little money, so let's move again. You just have to work hard with the goal of moving into a room with nice storage. From the time my mother passed away until I graduated from high school, I was taken care of by my aunt, but now I am finally on my own. I'm tired of a lot of things...... When I dodged the cardboard box and lay down in bed. Suddenly, the room shook with a rumbling sound. Earthquake!? I've got to run away!! ーーーOuch!! It was quicker for the pile of luggage to collapse than to jump up. Something solid falls on my head, and my consciousness becomes hazy. Dangerous. You might have been hurt. I want to get up, but I can't move. My head is pounding...... At that moment, I heard a voice like an old man in my head. "I will reincarnate you from this, and if you have any wishes, I will grant you one." Reincarnation? What nonsense are you talking about in this emergency? More than that, if there is someone, do something about the luggage that has fallen! Stuck! Ouch! 「…… It's understandable to be confused, but you don't have a lot of time. Say only one thing you want in the next world. I will give you the ability to match it. And live a new life with that ability." The voice in my head speaks to me in a nonchalant manner. What do you want? That's what I'm supposed to do. Storage!! Give it the best storage in the world! "You've had a hard time in this life, and you're going to have the best storage in the world. Live as a master." I have no memory of what happened after that.</p>

        <h3 id="b2">第二章  <br>(It seems i really was reincarnated)</h3>
        <p>"Alice, it's time to eat!" I'm going now-" It's Alice. It's embarrassing. Moreover, it is a three-year-old child. Isn't it possible to choose where to reincarnate a little more? From the age of 18, it suddenly goes backwards to the age of 3. My parents are beautiful men and women in their 20s. They are a very close, lovey-dovey couple. As proof of love, the person who is squealing next to him is his younger brother Kyle, 0 years old. She looks exactly like her mother, with clear eyes, fluffy blonde curly hair, and a doll-like baby. By the way, I, Aristia, am also a beautiful girl with blonde curly hair. It's one thing to say it yourself, but it's a look that makes you want to praise yourself. Apparently, I was reincarnated as the daughter of a farmer in a remote village called Azel Village. Three-year-olds are not allowed outside, so I don't know much about them. It seems that his father hunts, grows vegetables, and barters with the villagers. It's not flattering, but it's not poor either. From what my mother has heard, although it is a remote area, the climate is mild and the crops are fruitful. That's why I don't have a problem eating it. In my previous life, I was just about to get a job at an agricultural cooperative. Well, I wasn't interested in agriculture at all when I was in high school, but after I decided on a job, I studied agriculture to a certain extent. I hope that knowledge will help you a little. Therefore, I have no complaints about being reincarnated as a farmer's daughter. "Come on, let's eat." "I was lucky enough to hunt a lynx today, so I'm going to eat a lot." A stew with plenty of chicken and vegetables, as well as a little stiff bread. Still, the loving, homemade food is so delicious that it brings tears to your eyes. Thank you, God, for allowing me to reincarnate in this world. Healthy parents and a cute little brother. I know how happy that is, because I was alone in my previous life. I'm going to be filial to my parents in this lifetime. "Mr./Ms.'s stew is so good." "Well, Alice, you've suddenly become a good girl lately." "You're helping me clean up, too." Suddenly, I wondered, where did Alice's soul go before I was reincarnated as Alice? If her personality suddenly changes, her parents will be suspicious, so I try my best to pretend to be a three-year-old. I remembered my parents' faces and names from the time I was reincarnated, and I wonder if it means that my memories before reincarnation were added to Alice's original spirit. Now, if anything, the memories of my previous life are coming to the fore. Well, I guess I didn't have much memory of a three-year-old. Anyway, what happened to the promise that they would give me the best storage in the world? God. There is almost no storage in this small house, just a small barn outside. A really small hut where you can store farm tools and weapons. I wouldn't say this is the best in the world. I wonder if one day I'll be very rich, live in a big mansion, and get a lot of storage. I hope so. At that time, I still thought of storage as a chest of drawers, bookshelves, and closets.</p>
